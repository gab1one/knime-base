    <name>Extract Table Spec</name>
    <shortDescription>Node extracting the meta information from the input table 
    (column names, types, etc.).
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Node extracting the meta information from the input table (column 
			names, types, etc.) The meta information is referred to as the 
			table data specification and contains information such as column 
			names, types, domain values (list of possible values for 
			categorical columns) and lower and upper bounds. It also contains 
			the information which of the columns have a view handler associated
		   (optional operation). Each column in the input table is represented 
		   as a row in the output. This node can be used in conjunction with 
		   the Insert Column Header node, where the column names are extracted 
		   from the input table, then modified in the workflow and later merged 
		   back into the main table. 			
		</intro>
		<option name="Extract property handlers">
			If checked the information which of the columns have property 
			handlers e.g. color handler associated is extracted, otherwise not. 
		</option>
        <option name="Possible values as collection">
            If checked, the possible values of each columns are extracted as 
            possible values, otherwise not.
        </option>
	<option name="Format of Type Names">
		Determines how the types of columns are represented in the output
		table.
		The following options are available:
		<ul>
			<li>Identifier: The type names are represented with a unique
				identifier. This is the recommended option.</li>
			<li>Legacy Display Name: The type names are represented by their old
				display name. This option is intended to be used purely for
				backwards-compatibility for workflows created in version 5.4 or before.</li>
			<li>Display Name: The type names are represented by their display
				name. This name may change at any point with an update, so it is
				highly discouraged to match against this output in any way.</li>
		</ul>
