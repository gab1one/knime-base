	<shortDescription>
		Compares two tables with respect to their values as
		well as their column specs.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		The Table Difference Finder offers the functionality to compare two tables by
		means of their values and table specs. Firstly, the values in the selected 
		columns are compared in both tables, and the possible differences are shown
		for each row and column. Secondly, the types, domains, and positions of
		the selected columns are compared in both tables, and the results are shown
		for each column. The selected columns are either all columns in both
		tables, or a subset of columns in the reference table, i.e. the second input.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
		<option name="Compare entire tables">
		If this	option is checked all columns from the first as well as the second input will be compared against
		each other. Otherwise, the tables will solely be compared respective the selected columns of the 
		reference, i.e., the second input table. 
		<br/>
		<b>Note:</b> RowIDs are not being compared. 
		</option>
			<option name="Select columns from reference table">
				The list contains the names of those columns in
				the reference table to be included for the comparison. It allows you
				to select the columns manually (by moving them to the right panel),
				via wildcard/regex (all columns whose names match the wildcard/regex
				are included) or via type selection (all columns with a certain type
				are included). In case of manual selection, the behavior for new
				columns (i.e. that are not available at the time you configure the
				node)can be specified as either Enforce exclusion (new columns are
				excluded and therefore not used for comparison) or Enforce inclusion
				(new columns are included and therefore used for comparison).
			</option>
			<option name="Fail option:">
				<b>Never:</b>
				The The node will not fail on any differences between the two tables.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<b>Differing table specs:</b>
				The node will fail if any of the selected columns does not exist in
				the other table, or the columns differ in type or domain. 
				<i>Note</i> that differing column positions are being ignored.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<b>Differing values:</b>
				 On the first occurrence of differences in the values the node will fail.
