		<intro>
			This node removes all columns from the input table which contain more missing values than 
			a certain percentage.
			The filtering is only applied to the columns in the input list of the column filter panel.

        <tab name="Manual Selection">
			<option name="Include">
				This list contains the names of those columns in the input table
				to be included in the output table.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Exclude">
				This list contains the names of those columns in the input table
				to be excluded from the output table.
			</option>

				<option name="Filter">
                Use one of these fields to filter either the Include or Exclude
                list for certain column names or name substrings.
            </option>
            
            <option name="Buttons">
                Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
                list. Single-arrow buttons will move all selected columns.
                Double-arrow buttons will move all columns (filtering is taken into
                account).
            </option>
            
            <option name="Enforce Exclusion">
                Select this option to enforce the current exclusion list to stay
                the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
                of the excluded columns are not available anymore, a warning
                is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
                inclusion list.)
            </option>

                Select this option to enforce the current inclusion list to stay
                the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
                of the included columns are not available anymore, a warning
                is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
                exclusion list.)

        <tab name="Wildcard/Regex Selection">
        	<option name="Search Pattern">
				Type a search pattern which matches columns to move into the
				Include or Exclude list. Which list is used can be specified.
				You can use either Wildcards ('?' matching any
				character, '*' matching a sequence of any characters) or Regex.
				You can specify whether your pattern should be case sensitive.
