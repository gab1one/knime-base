    <shortDescription>
    	Pivots and groups the input table by the selected columns for pivoting 
    	and grouping; enhanced by column aggregations.

    <fullDescription>
    	<intro>
    	   <p>
        	Performs a pivoting on the given input table using a selected number
        	of columns for grouping and pivoting. The group columns will result
        	into unique rows, whereby the pivot values turned into 
        	columns for each set of column combinations together with each 
        	aggregation method. In addition, the node returns the total 
        	aggregation (a) based on only the group columns and (b) based on
        	only the pivoted columns resulting in a single row; optionally, 
        	with the total aggregation without pivoting.
           </p>
           <p>
            To change the aggregation method of more than one column select all
            columns to change, open the context menu with a right mouse click
            and select the aggregation method to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            A detailed description of the available aggregation methods can be
            found on the 'Description' tab in the node dialog.

          <option name="Aggregation methods">
            Select one or more columns for aggregation from the available 
            columns list. Change the aggregation method in the Aggregation 
            column of the table. You can add the same column multiple
            times. In order to change the aggregation method of more than one 
            column select all columns to change, open the context menu with a 
            right mouse click and select the aggregation method to use.
            Tick the missing box to include missing values. This option might
            be disabled if the aggregation method does not support missing
            values.
            The parameter column shows an "Edit" button for all 
            aggregation operators that require additional information. 
            Clicking on the "Edit" button opens the parameter dialog

                Uses the pivot name first and the aggregation name second joint
                by a + character.
                Keeps the original column names.
                Note that you can use all aggregation columns only once with 
                this column naming option to prevent duplicate column names.
                </li>
                <li>Aggregation name+Pivot name: 
                Uses the aggregation name first and the pivot name second joint

                <li>Pivot name:
                Uses solely the pivot name. Note that this option solely
                supports the selection of a single aggregation method to ensure
                uniqueness of the column names.

            All aggregation methods get an * appended if the missing value

            distinguish between columns that considered missing values in the
            aggregation process and columns that do not.

          <option name="Output column order">
            Defines the order of group and pivot columns in the output.
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Unspecified order:</b> The column order is not specified and may be determined by the

            	</li>
            	<li><b>Retain order:</b> Use the input to determine the output order. Group output columns are ordered
            	    the same as they are in the input table. Pivot columns are ordered based on their values' first
            	    occurrence in the input table.
            	</li>
            	<li><b>Lexicographic order:</b> Group and pivot column orders are sorted in lexicographic order

          </option>
          <option name="Maximum unique values per group">
	        Defines the maximum number of unique values per group to avoid 
	        problems with memory overloading. All groups with more unique
	        values are skipped during the calculation and a missing value is set 
            in the corresponding column, and a warning is displayed.
          </option>
          <option name="Value delimiter">
            The value delimiter used by aggregation methods such as concatenate. 
          </option>
          <option name="Process in memory">
            Process the table in the memory. Requires more memory but is faster
            since the table needs not to be sorted prior aggregation. 
            The memory consumption depends on the number of unique groups and
            the chosen aggregation method. The row order of the input table is 
            automatically retained.
          </option>
          <option name="Retain row order">
            Retains the original row order of the input table. 
            Could result in longer execution time.
            The row order is automatically retained if the process in memory
            option is selected.
          </option>
          <option name="Enable hiliting">
			If enabled, the hiliting of a group row will hilite all rows of this
			group in other views. Depending on the number of rows, enabling this 
			feature might consume a lot of memory.
          </option>
          <option name="Missing">
            Missing values are considered during aggregation if the missing 
            option is ticked for the corresponding row in the column 
            aggregation table.
            Some aggregation methods do not support the changing of the missing
            option such as means.
