	<name>Color Manager</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Assigns colors to a selected nominal or numeric column.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
	    Colors can be assigned for either nominal (possible values
	    have to be available) or numeric columns (with lower and upper bounds).
	    If these bounds are not available, a <i>'?'</i> is provided as a minimum
	    and maximum value. The values are then computed during execute.
	    If a column attribute is selected, the color can be changed with the
        color chooser.
		</intro>
		
    <option name="Column(s): ">
	    Select the column whose possible values or ranges should be used for 
	    color selection.
    </option>
    <option name="Nominal: ">
	    Assigns colors based on the possible attribute values of the selected 
	    column. Colors can be set individually per value ('Custom') or via predefined palettes (Set 1-3). 
	    The latter will apply colors also to new values present at execution time 
	    (as opposed to 'Custom' palette which will cause the node to fail). If there are more distinct values in the 
	    data than defined in the palette, colors will be re-used.
    </option>
    <option name="Range: ">
	    Assigns a color gradient based on a numeric attribute. If 
	    the range is known, the minimum and maximum are displayed in the list,
	    otherwise a '?' is shown. The color is determined by the position of 
	    the attribute's value within the numeric range: the corresponding color 
	    is set at the same position in the gradient.
    </option>
    <option name="Alpha: ">
        Adjust the color's alpha component in the range of 0..255. Please note,
        alpha composition is expensive in cases when operations performed are 
        not hardware-accelerated.
