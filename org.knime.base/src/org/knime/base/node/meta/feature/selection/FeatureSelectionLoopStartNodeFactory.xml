	<shortDescription>Start node for a feature selection loop</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node is the start of the feature selection loop. The
			feature selection loop allows you to select, from all the features in
			the input data set, the subset of features that is best for model
			construction.
			With this node you determine (i) which features/columns
			are to be held
			fixed in the selection process.
			These constant or
			"static" features/columns are included in each loop
			iteration and are
			exempt from elimination; (ii) which selection
			strategy is to be used
			on the other (variable) features/columns and
			its settings; and (iii)
			the specific settings of the selected strategy.
			<br />
			<br />
			The following feature selection strategies are available:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Forward Feature Selection</b>
					is an iterative approach. It starts with having no feature
					selected. In each iteration, the feature that improves the model
					the most is added to the feature set.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Backward Feature Elimination</b>
					is an iterative approach. It starts with having all features
					selected. In each iteration, the feature that has on its removal
					the least impact on the models performance is removed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Genetic Algorithm</b>
					is a stochastic approach that bases its optimization on the
					mechanics of biological evolution and genetics. Similar to natural
					selection, different solutions (individuals) are carried and
					mutated from generation to generation based on their performance
					(fitness). This approach converges into a local optimum and
					enabling early stopping might be recommended. See, e.g.,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">this article</a>
					for more insights.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Random</b>
					is a simple approach that selects feature combinations randomly.
					There is no converging and by chance (one of) the best feature
					combination
					will be drawn in an early iteration, so that early
					stopping might
					be recommended.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Static and Variable Features">Columns can be selected manually or by means of
				regular expressions. The columns in the left pane are the static
				columns, those in the right pane the variable columns. If you want
				to
				learn a supervised model (e.g. classification or regression), at
				least one static
				column and more than one variable column will be
				needed. For an unsupervised model
				(e.g. clustering), no constant
				column but only variable columns will be needed.
				Columns can be moved
				from one pane to the other by clicking on the appropriate button in
				the middle.
			</option>
			<option name="Feature selection strategy">
				Here you can choose between the selection strategies: Forward
				Feature Selection, Backward Feature Elimination,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic Algorithm</a>
				and Random.
			</option>
			<option name="Use threshold for number of features">
				[Forward Feature Selection, Backward Feature
				Elimination] Check this option if you want to set a bound for
				the
				number of selected
				features. Since Forward Feature Selection adds
				features while
				Backward Feature Elimination subtracts them, this will
				be an upper
				bound for Forward Feature Selection and a lower bound for
				Backward
				Feature Elimination.
			</option>
			<option name="Select threshold for number of features">
				[Forward Feature Selection, Backward Feature
				Elimination] Set the upper or lower bound for the number of
				selected
				features.
			</option>
			<option name="Use lower bound for number of features">
				[Genetic Algorithm, Random] Check this option if
				you want to set a lower
				bound for the number of selected features.
			</option>
			<option name="Use upper bound for number of features">
				[Genetic Algorithm, Random] Check this option if
				you want to set an upper
				bound for the number of selected features.
			</option>
			<option name="Population size">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Set the number of individuals in each
				population. Changing this value directly influences the maximal
				number of loop
				iterations which is
				<i>Population size * (Number of generations + 1)</i>
				. This is just an upper bound,
				usually less iterations will be
				necessary.
			</option>
			<option name="Max. number of generations">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Set the number of generations. Changing this
				value directly influences the maximal
				number of loop iterations which
				is
				<i>Population size * (Number of generations + 1)</i>
				. This is just
				an upper bound, usually less iterations will be
				necessary.
			</option>
			<option name="Max. number of iterations">
				[Random] Set the number of iterations. This is an
				upper bound. If the same feature subset is randomly
				generated for a
				second time, it won't be processed again but will be counted
				as
				iteration. Furthermore,
				if early stopping is enabled, the algorithm
				may stop before the max.
				number of iterations is reached.
			</option>
			<option name="Use static random seed">
				[Genetic Algorithm, Random] Choose a seed to get
				reproducible results.
			</option>

		<tab name="Advanced Options">
			<option name="Selection strategy">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Choose the strategy to use for the
				<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(genetic_algorithm)">selection of offspring</a>
				.
			</option>
			<option name="Fraction of survivors">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Set the fraction of survivors during evaluation
				of
				the next generation.
				<i>1 - fraction of survivors</i>
				defines the fraction of offspring which is evaluated for the next
				generation.
			</option>
			<option name="Elitism rate">[Genetic Algorithm] Set the fraction of the best
				individuals within a generation that are transfered to the next
				generation
				without alternation.

			<option name="Crossover strategy">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Choose the strategy to use for
				<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)"> crossover</a>
				.
			</option>
			<option name="Crossover rate">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Set the crossover rate used
				to alter
				offspring.
			</option>
			<option name="Mutation rate">
				[Genetic Algorithm] Set the mutation rate used to
				alter
				offspring.
			</option>
			<option name="Enable early stopping">
				[Genetic Algorithm, Random] Check this option if
				you want to enable early stopping which means that the
				algorithm
				stops after a specified number of generations/iterations without
				improvement. If using the
				random strategy, this is based on a moving
				average whereby the size of the
				moving window is the same
				number as
				the specified number of iterations. If the ratio of improvement
				is
				lower than a specified
				tolerance, the search stops.
			</option>
			<option
				name="Number of generations/iterations without improvement">
				[Genetic Algorithm, Random] Set the number of
				generations/iterations without improvement (or with less
				improvement
				than the specified tolerance in case of random strategy) used for
				early stopping. In case of
				random strategy it also defines the size
				of the moving window.
			</option>
			<option name="Tolerance">
				[Random] The tolerance used for early
				stopping which defines the
				threshold for the ratio of
				improvement. If
				the ratio is lower than the threshold, the strategy stops.
