	<shortDescription>
		Transfers files/folders taken from an input table to a specified destination folder.

		<intro>
            <p>
			This node copies or moves files from a source (folder or file) to another folder. The node offers options to
			either specify the destination based on a column in the input table or via a file chooser. If the 
			"Delete source files (move)" option is checked the node performs a move operation for which the source
			files will be deleted after the copying process is done.

		</intro>
		<option name="Source column">
			Allows to select the column containing the paths to the files/folders that must be copied/moved.
		</option>
		<option name="From table">
			Allows to select the column containing the destination, i.e., the new location and names of the 
			files/folders to be copied/moved. 
			<br/>
			<i>Note:</i> If the source references a file/folder the destination also has to be a file/folder.  
		</option>
		<option name="From file chooser">
			This option allows you to specify a folder where you want to copy/move the (source) files/folders to.
			There are three default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a location on your
                    local system.
                </li>
                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to write to a mountpoint.
                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in 
                	this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid, i.e. known, mountpoint.
                </li>
                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow, or the current workflow's data area.
                When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
                </li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. For this you have to enable the file system
			connection input port of this node by clicking the <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node's icon
			and choose <i>Add Destination File System Connection</i>.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node. The file system connection will
			then be shown in the drop-down menu. It is greyed out if the file system is not connected, in which case
			you have to (re)execute the connector node first. Note: The default file systems listed above can't be
			selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
		</option>
		<option name="Create missing folders">
			Select if the folders of the selected output location should be created if they do not already exist. If
			this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
		</option>
		<option name="Destination file path">
			Depending on the selected mode the location of the files/folders to be copied to the destination folder 
			will differ.
			<ul>
				<li><i>Include only the selected file/folder:</i>
					This mode ensures that the selected file/folder is directly copied into the destination folder.
				</li>
				<li><i>Include all folders in the source path:</i>
					This mode ensures that the folder containing the selected source file/folder will also be created
					inside the destination folder, i.e., if the source is <i>src_folder/src_subfolder</i> and the
					destination is <i>dest_folder</i> the content of the source is copied to 
					<i>dest_folder/src_folder/src_subfolder</i>.
				</li>
				<li><i>Include all folders in the source path succeeding the prefix:</i>
					This mode behaves similar to the <i>Include all folders in the source path</i> option, except that
					the specified folder prefix (the beginning of the path) is being ignored, e.g., if the specified 
					prefix is <i>src_folder</i> the source path is <i>src_folder/src_subfolder</i>, the source is
					copied to <i>dest_folder/src_subfolder</i>. <b>Note:</b> In special cases using this option 
					can try to copy the source file/folder to a location that is outside the specified destination. In
					this case the node will fail. 
				</li>
			</ul> 
		</option>
		<option name="Transfer policy">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Overwrite:</i>
					Will replace any existing file.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Overwrite if newer:</i>
					Will replace any existing file if the source file's last modified date is after the destination
					file's last modified date, otherwise the file will not be overwritten and the copy process is
					being continued.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Ignore:</i>
					Will ignore if a file already exists and continues the copying process.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Fail:</i>
					Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>		
		<option name="Delete source files / folders">
			If this option is checked all files which have been successfully copied to the destination folder
			will be deleted in the source folder. The output contains an additional column indicating if the file has
			been deleted (true) or not (false).
		</option>
		<option name="Fail on unsuccessful deletion">
			If the 'Delete source files (move)' option is activated and something goes wrong during the deletion process
			the node will fail. This option is only available if the before mentioned option is selected.
		</option>
		<option name="Detailed output">
			If selected the output will not only show the folder that has been copied/moved but also all the 
			files/folders it contains.
		</option>
		<option name="Fail if source does not exist">
			If selected the node will fail in case the source file/folder to copy/move does not exist.
		</option>
