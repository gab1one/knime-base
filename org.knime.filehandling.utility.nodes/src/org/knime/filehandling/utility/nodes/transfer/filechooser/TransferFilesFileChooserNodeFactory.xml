			This node copies or moves files from a source (folder or file) to another folder. The node offers options to
			either copy or move a single file, a complete folder or the files in a selected folder, with the option to
			include subfolders, to a specified folder. If the "Delete source files (move)" option is checked the node
			performs a move operation for which the source files will be deleted after the copying process is done.

		</intro>
		<option name="Read from">
			Select a file system which stores the files/folders you want to copy/move. There are four default file
			system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Local File System:</i>
					Allows you to select a file/folder from your local system.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Mountpoint:</i>
					Allows you to read from a mountpoint.When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the
					mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is
					disabled in this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing. A
					mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available. You won't
					be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Relative to:</i>
					Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path relative to the current mountpoint, current
					workflow or the current workflow's data area. When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose
					which of the three options to use.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
					Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime://protocol). When selected, a spinner
					appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds. In case
					it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.Browsing is
					disabled for this option.
				</li>
			</ul>
			To copy/move a file/folder from other file systems, click on <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the
			node icon followed by <i>Source File System Connection</i>. Afterwards, connect the desired file system
			connector node to the newly added input port. The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down
			menu. It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the
			connector node first. Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is
			provided via the input port
            <br/>
            <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a 
            </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
            <i>path flow variable.</i></a>.
		</option>
		<option name="Mode">
			There are three different file/folder modes available:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>File:</i>
					Copies a single file.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Folder:</i>
					Copies a single folder with all its files and the underlying folder structure.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Files in folder:</i>
					Copies the files in a folder and creates the necessary folder structure as in the source folder.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Filter options">
			Only displayed if the mode Files in folder is selected. Allows to specify which files should be included
			according to their file extension and/or name.It is also possible to include hidden files. The folder
			filter options enable you to specify which folders should be included based on their name and hidden status.
			Note that only folders in the file paths of the selected files will be copied.
		</option>
		<option name="Include subfolders">
			If this option is checked, the node will include all files from subfolders that satisfy the specified filter
			options. If left unchecked, only the files in the selected folder will be included and all files from
			subfolders are ignored.
		</option>
		<option name="Write to">
			This option allows you to specify a folder where you want to copy your file, files or folder in the end.
			This option has got the same options, except for the custom URL option, as the Read from option with regards
			to the file system options.

            <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
		</option>
		<option name="Create missing folders">
			Select if the folders of the selected output location should be created if they do not already exist. If
			this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
		</option>
		<option name="Destination file path">
			Depending on the selected mode the location of the files/folders to be copied to the destination folder 
			will differ.
			<ul>
				<li><i>Include only the selected file/folder:</i>
					This mode ensures that the selected file/folder is directly copied into the destination folder.
				</li>
				<li><i>Include all folders in the source path:</i>
					This mode ensures that the folder containing the selected source file/folder will also be created
					inside the destination folder, i.e., if the source is <i>src_folder/src_subfolder</i> and the
					destination is <i>dest_folder</i> the content of the source is copied to 
					<i>dest_folder/src_folder/src_subfolder</i>.
				</li>
				<li><i>Include all folders in the source path succeeding the prefix:</i>
					This mode behaves similar to the <i>Include all folders in the source path</i> option, except that
					the specified folder prefix (the beginning of the path) is being ignored, e.g., if the specified 
					prefix is <i>src_folder</i> the source path is <i>src_folder/src_subfolder</i>, the source is
					copied to <i>dest_folder/src_subfolder</i>. <b>Note:</b> In special cases using this option 
					can try to copy the source file/folder to a location that is outside the specified destination. In
					this case the node will fail. 
				</li>
			</ul> 
		</option>
		<option name="Transfer policy">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Overwrite:</i>
					Will replace any existing file.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Overwrite if newer:</i>
					Will replace any existing file if the source file's last modified date is after the destination
					file's last modified date, otherwise the file will not be overwritten and the copy process is
					being continued.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Ignore:</i>
					Will ignore if a file already exists and continues the copying process.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Fail:</i>
					Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Delete source files / folders">
			If this option is checked all files which have been successfully copied to the destination folder
			will be deleted in the source folder. The output contains an additional column indicating if the file has
			been deleted (true) or not (false).
		</option>
		<option name="Fail on unsuccessful deletion">
			If the 'Delete source files (move)' option is activated and something goes wrong during the deletion process
			the node will fail. This option is only available if the before mentioned option is selected.
		</option>
		<option name="Detailed output">
			If selected the output will not only show the folder that has been copied/moved but also all the 
			files/folders it contains.
