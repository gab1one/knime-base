		<option name="Variable selection">
			The String variables that will be converted to Path variables. The variables have to contain Strings with 
			correct Path /foo/bar.txt syntax.
		</option>
		<option name="File system">
			Select the file system to which the created paths should be related to. There are four default file system
			options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Local File System:</i>
					Resolve the path to your local file system.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Mountpoint:</i>
					Resolves the path to a mountpoint. When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the
					mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are grayed out but can still be selected. A mountpoint is 
					displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available. You won't be able to save
					the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Relative to:</i>
					Resolve the path relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data
					area. When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
					Resolve the paths to a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). When selected, a spinner
					appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and write timeout in milliseconds..
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore, you have to enable the file system
			connection input port of this node by clicking the <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node's icon
			and choose <i>Add File System Connection port</i>.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node. The file system connection will
			then be shown in the drop-down menu. It is grayed out if the file system is not connected in which case you
			have to (re)execute the connector node first.
			Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input
			port.
		</option>
		<option name="Suffix added to the new variables">
			The suffix that will be added to the name of the String variables that are converted to create the names of
			the new Path variables.
		</option>
		<option name="Fail if file/folder does not exist">
			Checks if the files or folders referenced by the created Paths are existing and will abort if one is not.
